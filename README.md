The one trying not to lose track at lap 23.

Why I Built This

The LP Run format puts lap counting responsibility on the runner or a companion.

This tool removes:
	•	Clipboards
	•	Separate stopwatches
	•	Guessing
	•	“Wait was that 26 or 27?”

It keeps the stands organized and the vibes intact.

Future Add Ons
